# Description
Here is where I will follow the tutorial for the [Rust Programming Language Book Chapter 3.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html)

# Installation
This repository uses a docker container, because I didn't want to download rust on my PC!
So, you'll need:

- Docker desktop
- VS Code (Optionally!)
