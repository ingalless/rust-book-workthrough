# Description
Here is where I will follow the tutorial for the [Rust Programming Language Book Chapter 4.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)

# Installation
This repository uses a docker container, because I didn't want to download rust on my PC!
So, you'll need:

- Docker desktop
- VS Code (Optionally!)

If you're using VS Code Dev Containers (which I highly recommend you do), then you can open the code in there and let rust be provided to you from docker.
